        <h1>Homeworks 4 & 7: Analogies and Mathematical Properties</h1>

        <h2>Analogies: LLN vs. Random Walk</h2>
        
        <p>Homework 7, a simulation of a <strong>Random Walk</strong>, shares a deep mathematical foundation with the previous assignment (homework 4) on the <strong>Law of Large Numbers (LLN)</strong>. Both are, at their core, simulations of a <strong>Bernoulli process</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>A Bernoulli process is a sequence of <code>n</code> independent trials, where each trial has exactly two outcomes (e.g., success/failure, secure/breached), and the probability of success remains constant for every trial (at least, in our Model 1).</p>

        <h3>Similarities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bernoulli Foundation:</strong> Both models are built on <code>n</code> independent trials.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HW 4 (LLN):</strong> A "trial" is a coin flip, with outcomes {Success, Failure} and probability <code>p</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>HW 7 (Random Walk):</strong> A "trial" is a week, with outcomes {Secure, Breached} and probability <br><code>q = (1-p)<sup>m</sup></code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Binomial Core:</strong> In both models, the total number of "successes" (<code>k</code> heads in HW 4, <code>k</code> secure weeks in HW 7) follows a <strong>Binomial Distribution</strong>, <code>k ~ Bin(n, q)</code>. Our Model 2 (decreasing attackers) is a generalization known as a <strong>Poisson Binomial Distribution</strong>, as the probability <code>q<sub>w</sub></code> is no longer identical for each trial.</li>
            <li><strong>Central Limit Theorem:</strong> As <code>n</code> (the number of trials/weeks) diverges, the resulting distributions in both simulations (Binomial and Poisson Binomial) converge to a <strong>Normal (Gaussian) Distribution</strong>. This is why the histograms take on a "bell curve" shape for large <code>n</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Differences: Average vs. Displacement</h3>
        <p>The primary difference between the two assignments is not in the underlying process, but in <i>what is being measured</i> and <i>what concept is being demonstrated</i>.</p>

        <h2>Mathematical Properties and Relationships</h2>
        
        <p>The distributions generated in these homeworks are intrinsically linked to fundamental concepts in combinatorics.</p>

        <h3>Binomial Coefficients & Combinatorial Coefficients</h3>
        <p>A <strong>combinatorial coefficient</strong>, specifically the <strong>binomial coefficient</strong>, answers the question: "How many different paths (trajectories) result in the same final score?"</p>
        
        <p>The number of ways to get exactly $k$ "secure" weeks in $n$ total weeks is given by "n choose k":</p>
        
        $$ \binom{n}{k} = C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$
        
        <p>This is precisely why the Binomial Distribution (from Model 1) has its name. The probability of any *single* path with $k$ successes is $q^k (1-q)^{n-k}$. Since there are $\binom{n}{k}$ such paths, the total probability of having $k$ successes is:</p>
        
        $$ P(k) = \binom{n}{k} q^k (1-q)^{n-k} $$

        <h3>Pascal's Triangle</h3>
        <p>Pascal's Triangle is a beautiful, recursive visualization of the binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it: $C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k)$.</p>

        <p>This triangle is also a **direct map of a symmetric random walk** ($q=0.5$). The value at row $n$, position $k$ literally counts the number of distinct paths a walker can take from the origin (0,0) to reach that point in $n$ steps. The "score" $S = 2k - n$ is just a re-labeling of the $k$-th position in row $n$.</p>
        
        <div class="img-container">
            
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;">The numbers in Pascal's Triangle (e.g., at row 4) show how many paths lead to each point: 1 path to -4, 4 paths to -2, 6 paths to 0, 4 paths to +2, and 1 path to +4.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Binomial Expansion</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Binomial Expansion</strong> is the algebraic generator for these probabilities and coefficients. It defines how to expand a power of a sum:</p>
        
        $$ (x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n-k} $$

        <p>The connection becomes clear if we set $x = q$ (probability of +1) and $y = (1-q)$ (probability of -1):</p>
        
        $$ (q + (1-q))^n = 1^n = 1 $$
        
        <p>This expansion shows that the sum of all possible outcomes is 1. Each term in the sum, $\binom{n}{k} q^k (1-q)^{n-k}$, is precisely the probability of ending up in the state with $k$ successes (which corresponds to a score of $S = 2k - n$).</p>

        <h3>The Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
        <p>A more subtle connection exists with the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...). While not directly counting the paths in *this* specific random walk, it appears in related combinatorial problems (e.g., counting paths that don't allow two consecutive steps in the same direction).</p>
        
        <p>The most famous link is visual: the **sums of the "shallow diagonals" of Pascal's Triangle are the Fibonacci numbers**. This elegantly ties all these concepts together: the Random Walk is mapped by Pascal's Triangle, whose coefficients are defined by the Binomial Expansion, and whose diagonals sum to the Fibonacci sequence.</p>

         <div class="img-container">
            
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;">Summing the diagonals of Pascal's Triangle reveals the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...).</p>
