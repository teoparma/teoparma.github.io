        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Averages, also called measures of central tendency or measures of location, summarize a
            dataset with a single value that describes the center or typical score. They can be computed
            in various methods: the most common, the Arithmetic Mean, is calculated by adding all the
            numbers together and the dividing by the count of numbers; the Median (the middle value in
            a sorted list) and the Mode (the most frequently occurring value) as well as Weighted
            averages, Geometric and Harmonic.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Depending on the type of data and its distribution (e.g., the presence of outliers), different averages 
            highlight different aspects of the phenomenon. This is why some prove to be more useful and representative 
            than others for describing that dataset.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Measures of Dispersion</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Measures of Dispersion, also called measures of variability or measures of spread,
            summarize a dataset with a single value that describes how spread out or scattered the data
            points are. They are a vital complement to measures of central tendency, as they indicate
            the "risk" or "uncertainty" in the data.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            They can be computed in various methods: the simplest, the Range, is calculated by
            subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. More robust and common
            measures include the Quartile Deviation (the spread of the middle 50% of data), the
            Variance (the average of squared deviations from the mean), the Standard Deviation (the
            square root of the variance), and the Mean Deviation (the average of absolute deviations
            from the mean).
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The choice of which measure of dispersion to use depends entirely on the type of data you
            have (scale of measurement) and the shape of its distribution (especially its sensitivity to
            outliers).

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Let's see how the different ways to calculate location and dispersion relate with different
                distributions. First a quick explanation of various kinds of distributions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Exponential Distribution</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The exponential distribution is a right-skewed distribution used primarily to model the
                waiting time until a specific event occurs in a process where events happen continuously
                and independently at a constant average rate.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                It is defined only for positive real numbers and its probability density function starts high at
                x=0 and then decays exponentially as x increases.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Key Property: Memoryless:</strong> This is its most distinctive feature. It means that the
                probability of an event happening in the future is independent of how much time has
                already passed.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 pl-4">
                <li>Time between customer arrivals at a service desk.</li>
                <li>Time until a component or machine failure (reliability engineering).</li>
                <li>Time between radioactive decays.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Cauchy Distribution</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Also known as the Lorentz distribution, the Cauchy distribution is a symmetric, bell-shaped
                distribution, but it's infamous in statistics for its extreme properties. It is characterized by
                having heavy tails, meaning extreme values (outliers) occur much more frequently than in a
                Normal distribution.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Key Property:</strong> The most significant characteristic is that its mean, variance, and all
                higher moments are undefined (they mathematically diverge to infinity). This is due to
                its heavy tails.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Applications:</strong></p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Normal Distribution</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The Normal distribution, or Gaussian distribution (often called the "bell curve"), is the most
                widely used and important distribution in statistics due to the Central Limit Theorem: It is
                perfectly symmetric and bell-shaped, with a range over all real numbers.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Key Property:</strong> The CLT states that the distribution of sample means (or sums) from
                any distribution will approach a Normal distribution as the sample size increases.

                The Log-Normal distribution is a continuous distribution for a random variable whose
                logarithm is normally distributed. It is defined only for positive real numbers and is
                right-skewed. It is used for quantities that cannot be negative and that tend to grow
                multiplicatively.
